# Terms of Service

_Last updated: March 13, 2026_

_Effective: February 27, 2026_

Thank you for showing interest in **PaperTrail**, an open-source Discord audit and message logging bot.

By using this service (either self-hosted or via any hosted instance),
you agree to the following Terms of Service ("Terms"). Please read them carefully before using the service.
If you do not agree, stop using the software immediately.

---

## 1. Parties And Scope

These Terms are a legal agreement between you ("you", "your", "user")
and the project maintainers of PaperTrail (collectively "we", "us", "PaperTrail").

The [bot](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrailBot),
its related
APIs, [1](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrail-API-Quarkus), [2](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrail-API-Spring),
and its [SDK](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrail-SDK)
are collectively referred to as the “Service.”

In addition to these Terms, you must also read and accept Discord’s [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms).

---

## 2. Allowed Use

You may use the Service for permitted purposes described in the project documentation.
You may self-host or run the hosted instance if available.

You are responsible for:

- Proper configuration of the Service.
- All activity conducted through your server.
- Ensuring you have authority to enable logging and process user data.

If you operate a server that uses the Service, you are considered the responsible party for messages and actions the
Service performs on that server.

---

## 3. Prohibited Use

The service is designed to operate within the limitations and acceptable use
policies of the Discord API. The service does not intentionally bypass rate
limits, scrape unrelated data, or collect information outside the events
necessary to provide its logging functionality.

Information retrieved from the Discord API is processed only for the purpose
of gathering and providing data for the guild in which the event
occurred.

You agree not to use the Service to:

- Harass, abuse, stalk, or otherwise violate the rights of others.
- Send unsolicited advertising or spam, including mass direct messages.
- Violate applicable local, national, or international laws.
- Abuse the Service in ways that violate Discord's Terms of Service or Community Guidelines.
- Attempt unauthorized access to internal systems, APIs, or infrastructure.
- Modify Service logs or administrative messages in a way that intentionally obscures the origin or purpose.

---

## 4. Self-hosting and your responsibilities

If you self-host the Service, you are solely responsible for:

- Data storage, retention, backups, and deletion policies.
- Security of your infrastructure.
- Compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws.
- Any modifications you make to the code and the consequences of those changes.

We provide the Service as open source; We do not control how self-hosted instances behave.

---

## 5. Privacy & data handling

The Service can collect and store message and guild data if you enable its features.
How data is collected, stored, and retained depends on your configuration (self-hosted) or the hosted instance’s
settings.

Read the [Privacy Policy](/PRIVACY.md) for full details on what is collected, how it is used, retention periods, and
user rights.

---

## 6. Outages, modifications, and availability

We strive to keep any hosted instances of the Service available,
but we cannot guarantee uptime. We may add, modify, or remove features at any time.

We are not liable for temporary outages, feature removals, data loss from outages,
or changes that affect your use of the Service.
If you rely on guaranteed uptime or SLAs, consider self-hosting and maintaining your own backups.

Delivering logs to your registered guild is attempted on a best-effort basis.
The Service does not track, record, or retain delivery attempts, success confirmations, or failure states.
We do not guarantee that any log message, embed, attachment, or API response will be successfully delivered, stored, or
remain available.

Operation of the Service depends on external systems and proper configuration, including but not limited to:

- Discord API availability and rate limits
- Internal API availability
- SDK implementation and usage
- Server permissions and channel configuration
- Network connectivity

We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation or that every event will be logged, processed, or stored.

We are not responsible for:

- Deletion or modification of log messages, embeds, attachments, or stored entries by server members.
- Permission changes that prevent logs from being sent or viewed.
- Channel deletions or structural server changes.
- Misuse or improper implementation of the SDK or API.
- Failures caused by outages, misconfiguration, API limitations, or third-party service interruptions.

If logging or event processing is critical to your operations, you are responsible for maintaining appropriate
permissions, monitoring, and backups.

## 7. No Warranty

The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, including fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement.

We are not liable for any damages, including but not limited to data loss, operational disruption, moderation outcomes,
or indirect or consequential damages arising from use of the Service.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, our total aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to the
Service shall not exceed $5 USD.

---

## 8. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the maintainers, contributors, and affiliates from any claims, liabilities,
damages, losses, and expenses arising from:

- Your use of the Service,
- Your breach of these Terms,
- Actions taken by users of your server.

---

## 9. Termination

Either party may terminate use of the Service at any time.

Upon termination:

- Hosted instance data may be deleted in accordance with the [Privacy Policy](/PRIVACY.md).
- Self-hosted data remains under your control.

We reserve the right to suspend or disable access to hosted instances for violations of these Terms or applicable law.

---

## 10. Changes to these Terms

We may update these Terms as the project evolves.
Material changes will be published through the project repository.

Continued use of the Service after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

---

## 11. Entire agreement

These Terms (together with the [Privacy Policy](/PRIVACY.md) and the [License](/LICENSE))
constitute the entire agreement between you and the project maintainers regarding the Service,
superseding prior agreements or representations relating to the Service.
