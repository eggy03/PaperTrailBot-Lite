# Using The Bot

### By Inviting It

A pre-configured and deployed instance is the easiest way to use this bot. Just invite it to your server and that's all.

Get it from here: https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1381658412550590475

Run the `/setup` slash command to see instructions on how to configure the bot for your server.

### By Self Hosting It

You can easily self-host the `LITE` version of the bot by reading the
guide [here](https://github.com/eggy03/PaperTrailBot-Lite).

You can also self-host the `ORIGINAL` version by reading the guide [here](/DEPLOYMENT.md).
The guide also mentions the difference between the `LITE` and the `ORIGINAL` versions.
